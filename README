Better Mail
===========


Better Mail is a simple application that I made because I was fed-up with the 
bugs and limitations in the stock Android 1.6 Gmail application.

The application's uses the mobile version of Gmail for its GUI (Like G-Wizz's 
apps for iOS devices).  But also implements a Broadcast Receiver on gmail-ls to
provide native Android push notifications.
